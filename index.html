                    Public Speaker Mewis Breij will guide you through Rotterdam within 3 hours.
                    He will tell the story of Rotterdam, but he will mainly speak about speaking. 
                    Rotterdam will serve as an example. 
                    He will use these stories to put his public speaking lessons into practice. 
                    He will also lead by example: (showing you how to do it//) and letting you rethink your communication. 
                    In this fun event you will gain perspective in to what’s out there to learn when it comes to public speaking.

                <h3>
                    Why Public Speaking?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Public speaking walk exists to show you the countless ways to speak with more impact. 
                    This event inspires you to see the importance of how to tell instead of what to tell. 
                    Ideas are only as good as the actions that follow the communication of these ideas. 
                    And as a good speaker understands: Inspiration and entertainment should walk together. 
                    Surroundings matter. 
                    That’s why the dynamic city of Rotterdam is our décor.

                <p>
                    Not long after I figured out I loved learning and reading, I fell on my head. I acquired a brain injury, only a few months after I started studying. My life slowed down, but my self-development journey got up to fifth gear. I loved reading and writing, but my eyes were weak. Looking for a way out, I inadvertently developed a passion for speaking. 
                    I listened to hundreds of books, hundreds of podcasts and even more TED Talks. 
                    I have been studying and practicing by giving tours and lectures to thousands of people. 
                    By the end of your Public Speaking Walk I invoked some of my passion for speaking with impact in you/hope that you copied even the slightest bit of my passion for speaking with impact.
